## Architecture

**Frontend**

- Built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**
- Client-side routing, server-side rendering (SSR), and API integration via REST

**Backend**

- **AWS Lambda** host docker image and exposed via API Gateway
- **DynamoDB** for storing user, course, and transaction data
- **S3** for video storage
- **CloudFront** for global low-latency video delivery

**Authentication**

- Powered by Clerk for secure, scalable user management

**Deployment**

- Frontend deployed on Vercel
- Backend and infrastructure hosted on AWS
- CI/CD automated with GitHub Actions for production deployments
- Static assets stored in S3 and served via CloudFront

---

## Tech Highlights

- **TypeScript** for both frontend and backend
- **REST API** design and implementation
- **Cloud Architecture** with AWS serverless stack
- **Database Design** with NoSQL DynamoDB modeling
- **Deployment Automation** with GitHub Actions workflows

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22
- AWS account (with IAM permissions for Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, CloudFront)
- Clerk account for authentication

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Michael-YZhou/Edvance
   cd edvance
   ```
2. Install dependencies for both client and server:

   ```bash
   # Install client dependencies
   cd client
   npm install

   # Install server dependencies
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   - In /client, create a .env.local file
   - In /server, create a .env file for AWS Lambda functions
   - Include variables for:
     - AWS credentials & config
     - Clerk API keys
     - Payment provider keys (e.g., Stripe)

4. Run the development server:

   Open two terminals:

   **Client (frontend)**

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

   **Server (backend)**

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000 (default port)

- Backend: Runs on its configured local API port (e.g., http://localhost:8001)

## Deployment

- **Frontend:** Automatically deployed to Vercel on push to main

- **Backend:** Deployed to AWS Lambda via GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline (or manually on AWS Console)

- **Assets:** Stored in S3 and delivered via CloudFront
